## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables that added a non-random amount of variance were vehicle weight, spoiler angle and whether the car was AWD or not. The slope is not considered to be zero due to the high degree of error. This linear model prediction does not predict mpg effectively due to the imperfection of the model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

For the whole manufacturing lot the data meets the design specification, however lot 3 has variance exceeding the design specs. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The difference between the maufacturing lots and the mean PSI of the population is negligable.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

## Note from Ross

Ran out of time on this one, and I understand there's a couple(many) areas of improvement. Will revisit.
